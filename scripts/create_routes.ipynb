    "__Notebook for creating a set of routes for MTurk experiments__ (@author: hmaddali@umd.edu)\n",
    "\n",
    "MTurkers who will be working on Project Sidewalk will only be exposed to a set of predefined routes. These routes will be generated from the sidewalk.street_edge table which stores an edge list representation of the google street view map.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tasks:\n",
    "1. Connect to postgresql \"sidewalk\" database\n",
    "2. Calculate the length of each edge (geodesic or euclidean).\n",
    "3. Select N distinct random seedpoints (as starting edges for N paths).\n",
    "4. Keep choosing the next edge using some mechanism till the continuous path_distance is approximately equal to some threshold mission_distance d_m. The mechanism for choosing the next edge can be:\n",
    "    * Random selection (Not exactly a random walk)\n",
    "    * Largest edge\n",
    "    * Edge that brings the path distance closest to d_m\n",
    "    The intention is to perform a kind of dept first search to get a continuous path that satifies our distance constraint (and in the future a constraint on the count and diversity of labels already present as ground truth on the path). If the path gets terminated before it can reach d_m length then the current edge is discarded and we start again from the previous edge. In this, I can also set the complexity of a path by the number of turns/number of intersections/length between intersections...\n",
    "5. Something that I would like to ensure is that there is low overlap between any 2 paths. If we have some overlap between 2 paths that the same turker is labeling then he/she might remember the positions where they placed the labels previously. This leads to a learning effect (ordering effect). I can formulate this as a decision problem. We can have a function generate_routes(map,region,N,mission_distance d_m,distance_delta d_del,overlap_threshold) such that the function outputs:\n",
    "    * True if we have a set of N routes within a region on a map that satisfy the constraint of d_m-d_del<=length<=dm+d_del and no 2 routes have an overlap of more than overlap_threshold. Overlap is defined as the Jaccard distance between 2 paths (represented by sets of edges). Ideally we want overlap_threshold to be as low as possible (equal to zero).\n",
    "    * False if we cannot find N such routes. We may need to increase our overlap_threshold. We can also discard some of the generated paths (lower the value of N).\n",
    "    \n",
    "    We want to implement the search problem version of this i.e. find the N routes that satisfy our constraints.\n",
    "    \n",
    "6. Place these paths in a \"routes_street\" dataframe (representing a directed path along the map) that has the columns:\n",
    "    1. route_id: Primary Identifier, Integer indicating which route a particular row belongs to. May have multiple edges with the same (source,target) tuple but they should belong to different predetermined routes.\n",
    "    2. source: Int id of the source node\n",
    "    3. target: Int id of the target node\n",
    "    4. street_edge_id\n",
    "    4. length: In miles\n",
    "    5. route_start_edge: Indicates if this is the starting edge of the route\n",
    "    6. route_end_edge: Indicates if this is the terminating edge of the route\n",
    "    Ideally we would like to have non-overlapping paths to avoid learning effects. However this might not be possible in practise. Two routes having a common edge will still be able to transition as expected since there is an additional route_id. So if ur current edge is common to 2 paths we transition to the currect next edge by checking (route_id,nextedge_id) instead of just (nextedge_id). (Important because of the existing way we transition between streetedges in a mission (by checking if already completed (and possibly random selection among available next edges))).\n",
    "7. Calculate an N-by-N matrix (inefficient) of pairwise-route-overlap (Jaccard distance). Filter out the routes below an overlap_threshold.\n",
    "8. Create \"routes_street\" (described above in point 6.) and \"routes\" table in the postgres db. The \"routes\" table has the following columns:\n",
    "    1. 'route_length': Total length of the route\n",
    "    2. 'mean_street_length': Average lengths of the component street edges\n",
    "    3. 'std_street_length': Standard deviation of lengths of the component street edges\n",
    "    4. 'street_count': Number of street edges forming the route\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: Change database connection details where necessary. My dbserver was running on localhost:5000"
