# __Notebook for creating a set of routes for MTurk experiments__ (@author: hmaddali@umd.edu)
# 
# MTurkers who will be working on Project Sidewalk will only be exposed to a set of predefined routes. These routes will be generated from the sidewalk.street_edge table which stores an edge list representation of the google street view map.
# 
# Tasks:
# 1. Connect to postgresql "sidewalk" database
# 2. Calculate the length of each edge (geodesic or euclidean).
# 3. Select N distinct random seedpoints (as starting edges for N paths).
# 4. Keep choosing the next edge using some mechanism till the continuous path_distance is approximately equal to some threshold mission_distance d_m. The mechanism for choosing the next edge can be:
#     * Random selection (Not exactly a random walk)
#     * Largest edge
#     * Edge that brings the path distance closest to d_m
#     The intention is to perform a kind of dept first search to get a continuous path that satifies our distance constraint (and in the future a constraint on the count and diversity of labels already present as ground truth on the path). If the path gets terminated before it can reach d_m length then the current edge is discarded and we start again from the previous edge. In this, I can also set the complexity of a path by the number of turns/number of intersections/length between intersections...
# 5. Something that I would like to ensure is that there is low overlap between any 2 paths. If we have some overlap between 2 paths that the same turker is labeling then he/she might remember the positions where they placed the labels previously. This leads to a learning effect (ordering effect). I can formulate this as a decision problem. We can have a function generate_routes(map,region,N,mission_distance d_m,distance_delta d_del,overlap_threshold) such that the function outputs:
#     * True if we have a set of N routes within a region on a map that satisfy the constraint of d_m-d_del<=length<=dm+d_del and no 2 routes have an overlap of more than overlap_threshold. Overlap is defined as the Jaccard distance between 2 paths (represented by sets of edges). Ideally we want overlap_threshold to be as low as possible (equal to zero).
#     * False if we cannot find N such routes. We may need to increase our overlap_threshold. We can also discard some of the generated paths (lower the value of N).
#     
#     We want to implement the search problem version of this i.e. find the N routes that satisfy our constraints.
#     
# 6. Place these paths in a "routes_street" dataframe (representing a directed path along the map) that has the columns:
#     1. route_id: Primary Identifier, Integer indicating which route a particular row belongs to. May have multiple edges with the same (source,target) tuple but they should belong to different predetermined routes.
#     2. source: Int id of the source node
#     3. target: Int id of the target node
#     4. street_edge_id
#     4. length: In miles
#     5. route_start_edge: Indicates if this is the starting edge of the route
#     6. route_end_edge: Indicates if this is the terminating edge of the route
#     Ideally we would like to have non-overlapping paths to avoid learning effects. However this might not be possible in practise. Two routes having a common edge will still be able to transition as expected since there is an additional route_id. So if ur current edge is common to 2 paths we transition to the currect next edge by checking (route_id,nextedge_id) instead of just (nextedge_id). (Important because of the existing way we transition between streetedges in a mission (by checking if already completed (and possibly random selection among available next edges))).
# 7. Calculate an N-by-N matrix (inefficient) of pairwise-route-overlap (Jaccard distance). Filter out the routes below an overlap_threshold.
# 8. Create "routes_street" (described above in point 6.) and "routes" table in the postgres db. The "routes" table has the following columns:
#     1. 'route_length': Total length of the route
#     2. 'mean_street_length': Average lengths of the component street edges
#     3. 'std_street_length': Standard deviation of lengths of the component street edges
#     4. 'street_count': Number of street edges forming the route
# 
#
